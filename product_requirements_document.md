## Problem Statement

### Current Market Pain Points
**Primary Problem:** Small to medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs struggle to create comprehensive, professional marketing plans due to lack of marketing expertise, time constraints, and the complexity of strategic marketing frameworks.

**Supporting Evidence:**

- Professional marketing consultants cost $150-500/hour, making them inaccessible to many SMBs
- Existing marketing plan templates are static and lack personalized guidance
- Business owners spend 40+ hours researching and creating marketing plans from scratch
- Most available tools focus on single aspects (social media, content) rather than comprehensive strategy

### Target Users
1. **Primary:** Small to medium business owners (1-50 employees)
2. **Secondary:** Entrepreneurs and startup founders
3. **Tertiary:** Marketing professionals seeking structured frameworks
4. **Future:** Students and educational institutions
